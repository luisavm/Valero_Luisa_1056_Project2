                <!-- Right paragraph-->
                <p> In the spring of 1986 the TRAA was formed by anglers
                concerned with the state of the fishery in the Thames River watershed,
                particularly the dwindling smallmouth bass population in the North Thames River. </p>

                       <p> The rainbow trout <span class="selectedBold">(Oncorhynchus mykiss)</span> is a trout and species of
                        salmonid native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. The steelhead
                        <span class="selectedBold">(sometimes called "steelhead trout") is an anadromous (sea-run)</span>
                        form of the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) or Columbia River redband trout (O. m. gairdneri)
                        that usually returns to fresh water to spawn after living two to three years in the ocean.
                        Freshwater forms that have been introduced into the Great Lakes and migrate into tributaries
                        to spawn are also called steelhead.

                      widely based on subspecies, forms and habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by
                      a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail,
                      which is most vivid in breeding males.</p>

                    <h3 class="hidden">Oncorhynchus mykiss</h3>
                    <p>The scientific name of the rainbow trout is Oncorhynchus mykiss. The species was originally
                    named by German naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius
                    Walbaum in 1792 based on type specimens from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia.
                    Walbaum's original species name, mykiss, was derived from the local Kamchatkan name used for the fish, mykizha.
                    The name of the genus is from the Greek onkos ("hook") and rynchos ("nose"), in reference to the hooked jaws of
                    males in the mating season (the "kype"). <span id="sourceWiki">Source: Wikipedia</span></p>
